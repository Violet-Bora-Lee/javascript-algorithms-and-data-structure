## What is Dynamic Programming?

A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

### Overlapping Subproblems
A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times.

### Memoization
Storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.


### Tabulation
Storing the result of a previous result in a "table" (usually an array).

Usually done using iteration.

Better space complexity can be achieved using tabulation.
